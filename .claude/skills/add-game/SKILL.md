You are adding a game to a CSV file at the project root.

## Mode detection

Check the first argument:

- If it starts with `wishlist` (case-insensitive), set **mode = wishlist** and treat any remaining text as the game name.
- Otherwise, set **mode = games** and treat all args as the game name.

**games.csv** columns:

```
name,system,rating,genre,release_date,last_played,image_url,currently_playing
```

- `currently_playing` is optional and managed by the **now-playing** skill —
  this skill always appends 7-field rows and never sets it. (The CSV parser
  treats a missing trailing field as false.)

**wishlist.csv** columns:

```
name,system,genre,release_date,image_url,starred,date_added,notes
```

- `genre` is pipe-separated for multiple genres (e.g. `Action-Adventure|Puzzle`)
- `rating` (games only) must be one of: `Perfect`, `Great`, `Good`, `Okay`, `Bad`, or empty
- `starred` (wishlist only) is `true` or empty
- `date_added` (wishlist only) is today's date in ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD` — get it with `date +%F`
- `notes` (wishlist only) is free text or empty
- `release_date` / `last_played` are ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`, or empty

---

## Step 1 — Determine game name

If the game name was provided (after stripping the `wishlist` prefix if present), use it. Otherwise, ask the user for it before proceeding.

---

## Step 2 — Read existing systems and genres

**Always read `games.csv`** to extract:

- All unique values from the `system` column → use as the option list when asking the user to pick a system
- All unique genre tokens from the `genre` column (split each cell on `|`) → use as a reference when mapping Wikipedia genres

If **mode = wishlist**, also read `wishlist.csv` and merge any additional system/genre tokens not already found in `games.csv`.

---

## Step 3 — Look up game data on Wikipedia

The Wikipedia lookup logic lives in a helper script, `.claude/tools/wikipedia.py`
(see `.claude/tools/README.md`). Run it from the project root.

Search Wikipedia for the game — this prints a JSON array of candidate page titles:

```bash
python3 .claude/tools/wikipedia.py search "GAME_NAME"
```

Pick the most relevant result (clearly a video game, not a film or book adaptation). If the searched title is an **enhanced edition or port** (e.g. "Persona 5 Royal", "Portal on Switch") with no dedicated article — it's covered inside the parent game's article — say so, use the parent page, and confirm the key data (system, edition) with the user before continuing. Then fetch its infobox fields — this prints a JSON object:

```bash
python3 .claude/tools/wikipedia.py infobox "PAGE_TITLE"
```

The output looks like:

```json
{
  "genre": "Metroidvania, Action-adventure",
  "platforms": "Windows, Nintendo Switch",
  "released_raw": "{{vgrelease|NA=February 24, 2017|WW=...}}"
}
```

- If the page has no video-game infobox, the output is `{"error": "no_infobox"}` — fall back to asking the user manually (see Notes).
- `released_raw` is intentionally left un-cleaned. It may contain template markup like `{{vgrelease|NA=...|EU=...}}`. Extract the **North America (NA)** date from it. If no NA-specific date exists, use the earliest worldwide date. Always prefer NA. Convert to `YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## Step 4 — Resolve ambiguity and confirm data

### System

- Map the Wikipedia platforms to systems that appear in `games.csv` (read in Step 2).
- If the game shipped on multiple platforms **and more than one maps to a system in the library**, ask the user to pick via `AskUserQuestion`. Use the existing system names as options, plus "Other" appended automatically.
- If it maps unambiguously to one system, use it without asking.

### Release date

- Always use the **North America release date**. If no NA-specific date is available, use the worldwide date.
- For a **port or enhanced edition**, use the game's **original NA release date**, not the port's (e.g. Portal on Switch keeps its 2007 date).
- No need to ask the user about dates — just resolve it and move on.

### Genres

- Use the genres exactly as listed in the Wikipedia infobox side panel.
- Map them to genres that already exist in `games.csv` (read in Step 2) where there is a clear match.
- If a Wikipedia genre doesn't match any existing genre, include it as-is — new genres are fine.
- Do not limit genres to any fixed list.

After resolving all fields, **output a single summary message** to the user showing the game name, system, release date, and genres you found. Note anything that was ambiguous.

---

## Step 5 — Collect mode-specific fields via dialog

### If mode = games

Use `AskUserQuestion` with exactly **two questions**:

1. **Rating** — options: `Perfect`, `Great`, `Good`, `Okay`. "Other" is auto-appended; the user can note `Bad` or leave blank. If the user says they're **currently playing** the game (not finished), skip this question and leave the rating blank.
2. **Last played date** — options: the game's NA release date as the first option (mark it "(Recommended)" if the user is likely unsure, i.e. it was released more than a year ago), then the first day of the current year and 2 prior years (e.g. `2026-01-01`, `2025-01-01`, `2024-01-01`). "Other" is auto-appended for anything else. All dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Do NOT include today's date as an option. Note: `AskUserQuestion` allows a maximum of 4 options — the release date counts as one, leaving room for 3 year entries. Exception: if the rating question was skipped because the game is currently being played, skip this question too and use today's date (`date +%F`).

### If mode = wishlist

Use `AskUserQuestion` with exactly **two questions**:

1. **Starred?** — options: `Yes`, `No`.
2. **Notes** — options: `No notes`, `Replay`. "Other" is auto-appended for anything custom (e.g. "Recommended for Pao", "Remake of X").

## Step 6 — Fetch cover art from IGDB

Check whether credentials are set:

```bash
[ -n "${IGDB_CLIENT_ID}" ] && [ -n "${IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET}" ] && echo "ok" || echo "missing"
```

If `missing`, stop and tell the user: "Cannot continue — `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` and `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` must be set in your environment."

### Get an access token:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token?client_id=${IGDB_CLIENT_ID}&client_secret=${IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET}&grant_type=client_credentials" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])"
```

### Search IGDB for up to 4 matches:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.igdb.com/v4/games" \
  -H "Client-ID: ${IGDB_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d 'search "GAME_NAME"; fields name, cover.url; where cover != null; limit 4;'
```

For each result, upgrade `cover.url`: replace `t_thumb` → `t_cover_big` and `//` → `https://`.

---

## Step 7 — Preview and confirm cover

For each IGDB result show:

- The matched game title
- The cover: `![cover](IMAGE_URL)`
- The raw image URL

Use `AskUserQuestion` with one option per match plus "Skip cover art".

---

## Step 8 — Write to the target CSV

Get today's date (wishlist only):

```bash
date +%F
```

**If mode = games**, append to `games.csv`:

```
NAME,SYSTEM,RATING,GENRE,RELEASE_DATE,LAST_PLAYED,IMAGE_URL
```

**If mode = wishlist**, append to `wishlist.csv`:

```
NAME,SYSTEM,GENRE,RELEASE_DATE,IMAGE_URL,STARRED,DATE_ADDED,NOTES
```

- `starred`: `true` if the user said Yes, otherwise empty
- `date_added`: today's date from `date +%F`
- `notes`: the user's answer, or empty if "No notes"

Use `printf '%s\n' 'ROW' >> /full/path/to/FILE.csv` to append.

- Wrap `name` in double quotes if it contains a comma
- Join genres with `|`
- Leave empty fields as empty strings between commas

Print a confirmation showing the exact row appended.

---

## Notes

- If Wikipedia returns no infobox or the page can't be found, fall back to asking the user for genres, platform, and release date manually.
- If IGDB returns no results, offer to retry with a different search term or accept a direct URL.
- If the user skips cover art, use empty string for `image_url`.
- Do not run `fetch-covers.ts`.
- Do not commit or push — only modify the target CSV.
- If the game was added as currently being played, offer to run the `now-playing` skill next to flag it.
