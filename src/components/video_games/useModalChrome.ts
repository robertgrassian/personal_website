// Two lifecycles, one hook. The mount-only dialogs (AddGameModal,
// EditGameModal, EditWishlistModal) render only while open, so they leave
// `enabled` at its default and the effects run on mount and clean up on unmount
// — no isOpen plumbing. StatsPanel cannot work that way: it slide-animates in
// via `translate-x-full` and so stays mounted while closed, which is why it
// passes `enabled={isOpen}` and the effect body bails when false.
//
// Generic over the focus target's element type so callers can pass a
// `useRef<HTMLButtonElement>`/`useRef<HTMLInputElement>` without a variance
// cast.
